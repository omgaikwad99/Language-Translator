English to German Neural Machine Translation
This Jupyter notebook trains a sequence-to-sequence neural network to translate text from English to German.

Contents
The notebook contains the following:

Imports TensorFlow and Keras libraries
Uploads German text data file
Preprocesses data into input and output sequences
Creates encoder and decoder LSTM models
Trains model to translate English to German
Implements inference to decode English input to German translation
Prints sample English input and German translation output
Model Details
The model is an encoder-decoder LSTM sequence-to-sequence architecture. The encoder LSTM encodes the English input text into a latent vector representation. The decoder LSTM is initialized with the encoder state and generates the German translation token-by-token.

Training
The model is trained for variable epochs with a batch size of 64. Some key training hyperparameters are:

Latent dimensionality: 256
Optimizer: RMSprop
Loss: categorical crossentropy
Metrics: accuracy
The training data is a parallel English-German text file with tab-separated sentences.

Usage
To use this notebook to train your own English-German translator:

Upload a parallel corpus file to Google Colab
Preprocess into input and output sequences
Adjust model hyperparameters and training parameters if needed
Train model and sample translation outputs
